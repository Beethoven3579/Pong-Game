## Project Summary
This game was built using a Udemy tutorial. I essentially used this as an introduction to game programming as well as a stepping stone to building
my snake game application. This was a very useful learning experience. I learned about how to make objects move and detect collisions. I learned about detecting mouse position during game play. I learned about basic draw methods such as fillStyle, beginPath, arc and fill. I also started to scratch the surface of very simple machine learning.
